67272 Chess Store Project
===

This is my version of the [67-272 Chess Store Project](http://67272.cmuis.net/projects). 
All passwords are 'secret' in the system for all users. The list of known users include (username, role): 

- Mark ('mark', admin)
- Alex ('tank', admin)
- Karen ('kirvine', customer)
- Ben  ('bjunker', customer)
- Israel ('imadueme', customer)
- Mark V ('mvella', customer)
- Melanie ('melfree', customer)
- Rick ('rhuang', manager)
- Becca  ('bkern', manager)
- Connor ('chanley', shipper)
- Sarah ('srf', shipper)

There are other 40 customers randomly generated in the system along with 45 schools.  The known customers should have 3-5 orders each and 20 other random customer/school combinations will also have placed orders. (Five of those orders have been placed either today or the day before and haven't been shipped yet, so shipper list will have some items to ship.)
